# ISS and Atronauts ðŸš€

Welcome to the ISS and Astronauts App, a React project designed to display information about astronauts currently in space as well as the current location of the Internationl Space Station!

## Project Overview

The app fetches data from an external API and presents a table with astronaut names and the crafts they are currently aboard. It utilizes Redux for state management, Firebase for authentication, and several other utilities for a seamless user experience.

## Notes
- ignore compile error on start. It's a ts error due to the verson of firebase
- tried to add Facebook login as well but it requires a policy page and an app review of 5 days. There is commented out code for that section
